âœ… **What happens when you run this?**
1. Creates an **S3 bucket** (private).  
2. Uploads a sample `index.html`.  
3. Creates **CloudFront Distribution**.  
4. Configures S3 bucket policy â†’ only CloudFront can fetch files.  
5. Outputs a CloudFront domain (like `d123abc.cloudfront.net`) â†’ your website URL.

ðŸ‘‰ Do you want me to package this as a **ready-to-deploy zip** like before, or do you want to extend it with **custom domain + SSL (ACM certificate)** support?
